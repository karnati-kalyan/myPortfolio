# Kalyan Karnati

Hello! I'm Kalyan Karnati, a passionate and dedicated software engineer with a strong background in computer science and engineering. I hold a Master's degree in Computer Science from North Carolina State University, where I honed my skills in software engineering, data analysis, and machine learning. My journey in technology began with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from CVR College of Engineering, Hyderabad, where I developed a solid foundation in programming, algorithms, and database systems.
                
                I am proficient in multiple programming languages and have hands-on experience with a variety of tools and technologies that drive modern software development. Whether it's designing scalable systems, crafting elegant algorithms, or diving deep into data, I am driven by the desire to solve complex problems and create impactful solutions.
                
                When I'm not coding, I enjoy exploring new technologies, contributing to open-source projects, and continuously learning to stay updated with the ever-evolving tech landscape.
